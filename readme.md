Description:
This is an algorithm that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort technique. It works by comparing and swapping adjacent elements of the array until they are in the correct order.

Usage:
To use this algorithm, you need to input the size of the array and its elements, and then call the "sort" function. The sorted array will be printed to the console.

Complexity:
The time complexity of Insertion Sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) since it does not require any additional memory to sort the array.

Note:
This algorithm is suitable for small arrays, but for larger arrays, more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort are preferred.
